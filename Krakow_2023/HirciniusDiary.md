# Hircinius'es diary
===============================================================================

## First

*Cough! Cough! - As a fine mist of pulverised viscera and bone meal was inhaled by Hircinius, coughing broke eternal darkness and silence in a crypt deep under the mausoluem.*

*Hircinius studied his hand, starting from his three fingers and a thumb and going up. It was chewed up by a zombie. Not that bad as it sounds, but still, there were few droplets of blood and lymph oozing out.*

— Meeeh, what a barkle it would be to end and pass out in a place like this! At least it's Krynn, not some long-forgotten shithole like Klah!

*Goatman frantically flipped through his possessions, until he found an old, dusty tome, bound in a heavy corroded metal frame with omnious imaginery stamped on it. Second rummaging, and it was joined by the bottle of ink*

— Yeah, that will do! I can't find most of proper spices here anyway!

*Hircinius doused his tail in a bottle, opened the tome with a creaking sound and shuffled the pages until there were few mostly blank ones in a row*

— Oooh, my old tail aches! Maybe this sort of a massage helps.

*For a while, darkness was disrupted only by wet splotching sound as Hircinius was scribing using the tail tip:*

```
	Find a lightbug larvae that are in a third stage of molting.
	Do not confuse with a wispbug! It is deadly! Lightbug glows with a yellowish hue, while wispbug - with bluish!
	Do not collect older larvae! They are deadly because of accumulated toxins!
	Do not collect younger ones! They will burrow into your fingers!
	Collect a whole cup.
	Gently squeeze out bowels - you don't want them! They taste awfully and are deadly poisonous!
	You know that it is good if it still squiggling, so proceed with...(spots and stains cover the rest of the recipe)
```

Oi, my dear dairy!
That is the first entry!
One day I will grasp how three moons thing work here, what is year... But that day is not today.
Hope only me can read it, as I use obscure scratches and movements of a tail code.
Maybe some planeswalker will eventually find it and will pass my legacy to the proper people?
And if you use Comprehend Languages, shame on you! Stop looking into other people private notes! If hundreds of pages of recipes did not bored you out, maybe Explosive Runes will! [cleverly hidden dick picture attached]

Ahem, going back... how I did ended up here in the first place?
My memories are hazy. Faces and places are blurred.
Was it some berk fool cultist trying to sacrife a poor puppy at crossroads and using all the wrong wards? Was puppy puppeteering the cultist? Hard to tell who was the smart one out of two.
Or it was Summon Planar Ally (Lesser [followed by a sad smiley face])? And to think, they bargained down to 74 GP! Good thing that all the wards and protocols were wrong again.
Or it was both, but what was first?
Anyway, I was tickled in! Oh my Lady, why I am so ticklish?

So, there ...erm there was that prince, I think? Around the ruins of ...Shittle-Bee?

They wanted to gather some berk fools and send them on a suicidal mission to place named Nordmaar to find out what is happening there.
Figured out that Nordmaar is supposed to be the warm place - the more you go to the north, the warmer it becomes! It was cool where I manifested, my hoovesies do not like cold.
But that people were jesters! They did not gave any sealed/signed letter or document or contract! Said this will only raise suspicion. We were expected to go incognito, as travellers.

"Then why not to use Teleport, or scry?" - I asked. "What a good idea! Please, use" - was the answer. Arrgh! That was a good comeback. I can't. I'm not a wizard.

Welp, pretending to be a minotaur was not working out well.
And I don't want to be taxidermed, or used for magical components, or put in a cage and shown at a village fair by berks!
Strangers come, strangers go, don't stay for a long or you draw too much suspicion, - that line of thinking makes sense.
The reward is the travel itself.

So there were other unfortunate ones volunteering to boldly venture into unknown (and even more boldly wanting some hefty reward!) -
Twinkle, the cheeky gnome, - nice to see some gnomes in Krynn!;
Jewel, human - maybe a hobo from big city? I can swear there are rats following him!
Some other strong dude? - Think he had a second thought about this "secret unauthorized suicide mission with no pay in advance" and bailed out.

Intrepid wannabe adventurers (we) decided to visit docks and find a ship to cut the first part of travel fast and efficiently.
I'm still getting used to customs of those lands. On a way there we met some orcs that gave a hearty welcome and even were so kind as to share their gold, armor and weapon with us! What a lovely people!

Ship was manned by goblins, and the trip was unexpectedly pleasant. We were visited by a tentacled monster, he probably wanted to give us hugs and wish a safe travel. Some members of the goblin crew were so excited, they jumped overboard and started exercising by swimming around the ship. Exercise is good for your health.

Then another spectacular sight caught us surprized - an airship exploded, and some elf (or not? all humanoids are similar) named Meridith fell out of it! Goblins were awestuck, and welcomed the survivor by trembling and covering. Really impressive entrance. Meridith told us that he's in fact from the lands we were sent to explore, but haven't been to them for 17 years. And he wants to come back. Is 17 years longer than 17 days? Maybe he's the counter-spy sent to intercept us by people who do have access to scrying? Anyway, he seems to know the place, and with that I feel that our chances of success are greater than 0.

Jewel enchanted some berries. Wonder where he grows and hides them?

Soon enough, we saw the land! Our first leg of the trip ended a little to the south from the city named Haligoth.

***

After a short overland trip, Haligoth gates bid us welcome.
Going through doors and arches is always a challenge, a thrill - what if it a one-Way that you will go through and never return?
This one was opened by speaking "Silence" in some dialectical variant.

Entering the city, I was afraid that the foolish peasant berks are going to be scared of me, but alas - our elf was scaring them more! What a superstitious folk! They think that our elf friend is going to spoil their milk! (Probably)

Anyway, we found some half-decent inn, and bought some supplies. It was a time to plan the path forward.
Blindly going the shortest way seemed to be something the one who wants to get boxed would do.
I don't want to get boxed, - strength is in numbers, need to find some travel companions. So I went out and found some humanoids going northward! They were gathering somewhere at the northern exit of the city.

But when we returned together with elven friend, they were gone. In a hindsight, I should have asked their names. And marked location on map. Or bound them.

Searching for new companions to travel with, we stumblen upon an old man. He was slow, did not looked threatening at all, so we parted ways and come back to the inn.

Presence of the elven friend made the bartender deaf. What an interesting effect! I shaked some beer out of the bartender, and it was time to get some well-deserved rest.

But alas! No rest for the wicked. In a mid of the night, we were waken up by peeping and scratching sounds. Rats! Huge rude rats sniffing around! Many rats, larger ones bossing around smaller rats. It's a trap! I knew this! There is a huge brain-rat down under the sity, in a pool of bringe water! And it commands lesser rats with psionics! THEY WILL EAT AND VIOLATE OUR BRAINS! I SAW IT ON THE OTHER PLANES! WINDOWS ARE BARRED! COBBLESTONE DOWN UNDER THEM! NO WAY OUT!
The only sensible thing to do was panic and out-confuse those rat intruders. They want to confuse me, I'll confuse them instead! Obscuring Mist! Entire room become filled with a thick opaque mist. KILL! Time to kill some rats! They went down, one by one, starting with the thickest one. I exceled at completely flaying it in one sweep with a spiked chain; skin and fur detached from the rest of the body.

Then Meridith casted Gust of Wind, - the mist was whoosed out. Rats went into retreat! Weaklings! Time to celebrate the truimh!
But no. Jewel was shaken, almost crying. Was he bitten by rats? No, quite the opposite. Apparently the biggest one was his own belowed rat, and I just killed it. Should have put a collar with tag or something.

Morning came, and we counted our losses. Rations and foodstuffs were all eaten! Hoboman Jewel was sad and griefing. AND THE RATS WERE STILL THERE SOMEWHERE, HIDING AND SCHEMING. BETTER TO GET OUT OF THE CITY ASAP. Locals said that it is perfectly normal, - it is the way moon works on rats, and it's going to get even worse before going back to normal. Yep, time to leave as fast as we could, even without extra travel companions. Haligoth dwellers can have fun with rats all by themself.

On a way northwards, we found some magic totem! With a real magic seeping from it! It operated on the "tit for tat" principle - you leave yours offering, you can take another offering instead. We swiped leather armor for a wooden mace for Jewel. But it did not made Jewel happy. Need to honour the memory of a dead rat (alas, I forgot it' name).

Finally, Jewel made his mind: ferret will make him happy! Just need to find and befriend one.
Time to make a detour towards the elven woods! Not to mention that going through dangerous barren wilderness without company is way too barmy. Not gonna lie, it took us some error and trial, but we headed towards place known as Fayd.

After day of travel, we made a camp. Everything was nice and quiet (seeing in the dark helps) for a while. But we can't always have nice things. Peaceful sleep was disrupted by an apeman stumbling into the camp and right into the bonfire! He was behaving all agitated and menacing until Jewel calmed him a bit down. When I thougt that all was fine and we made a peaceful contact with a local, two more apemen appeared (more humanoid-looking than the first one)! Their faces were painted with dirt, probably some of wood-dweller thing.
Instead of sitting at bonfire, sharing a drink from the horn and singing songs, they took bows and aimed them at the first apeman!
What a rude uncivilized berks!
Jewel tried to talk them down, but to no avail. They were not going away without the first one,
Second one tried shooting, but both of his bows failed. Kids should not play with pointed objects!
Keeping this in mind, I disarmed the third one, snatching the bow from his hands before he cut himself with a string.
Instead of hearing "Thanks, sorry, I won'be be doing it again. Let us all be friends!" I saw a horror in his eyes.
Phew, maybe now is the time to sit back and laugh at the foolisness on one's action?
But nooo, berks beg to differ.
The first one, the one that was chased, acted. He took both of chasers, one after another, and straight ripped them apart! In halves! That was unfortunate. I honestly thought that he was hugging and embracing them!
Then apeman stared at us, and run into the forest.
Overconfidence and rudeness kills, what can I say. But also brings some loot to bypassers.
Putting bits and pieces (4 bows, 2 of them broken, arrows) into the newly acquired bag of holding, we finally approached Fayd.

Fayd was a disappointment. Not even a town, but bunch of elven dwellings in trees. Elves were friendly: they did not showered us with arrows or took our scalps for souvenirs.

Jewel found an elf, well-versed in the ways of forest, and got informed that there were no ferrets in Feyd, but they surey can be found nearby. Thus they both departed, promising to come back in couple of days.

I decided to resupply in the meantime. Unfortunately, noone of locals spoke Common. What a bummer! After some awful hand gestures and attempts at negotiations they pointed to the treehouse of an elf who spoke Common. Of course, the trehouse was at the very top! I tried to fish out the elf using magical lights and sounds, and screaming into the sky, but all was futile. Ooooh, I'm way too old for that shit, but there was no other way. I climbed up and found the cheeky common-speaker at home! Now hustle become easier. With the help from guide/translator everything that could be conceivably of use - ropes, long sticks, nets, oil, javelins (short sticks), spears (knife on a very long stick) was purchased.

***

Took me some time to prepare, but the masterpiece was done. A celebratory pate, to honour the memory of the dead rat and to cheer Jewel up!
Made from the rat itself, and best parts of those two squishy apemen (thanks, bag of holding, for making it easy)! All nicely minced, and sculpted to resemble a big dire rat.
A bit of spirits to slow down fermentation, some wild elven herbs and cherry on the top - a splattering of poison prom my tail to spice it up (was really painful to squeeze a bit out). Real delicacy.

Jewel came two days later. As I was preparing to festively offer him pate, he simply walked past by, bid us farewell, and departed without taking a second look. I think something broke deeply inside of him.
Maybe he was disappointed because we grossly misunderstood the way of nature - those apemen were proctreating by splitting up in halves and we disturbed them?

Anyway, adventure awaits! Twinkie came up with a great idea - instead of wearing down one's hoovesies and risking to encounter all sort of nasties the wilderness, travel by river!

Locals offered us to buy a boat. That was sweet, but the price was exorbitant. Thanks to Twinkie we managed to rent a raft with a group of experienced raftsmen and haggle the price further down!

And thus we went down the river. Bend after bend, confluence after confluence. Quiet and peaceful.

Somewhere along the road, I fed pate to fishes. I put a lot of effort into making it, but it was spoiled now - there was mushroom growth all over it.

Soon, we approached place named Auchuran, followed by trail of belly-up swimming fish. Must be a quirk of local fish.

As the raft was secured, the ferret jumped out of it and run away! We had a ferret with us the whole time! Maybe it was polymorphed Jewel having second thoughts?

Against all the sane wisdom, we entered the settlement and approached locals. They were excited to see us, especially our elven friend Meredith.
From what I got, Auchuran ruled by kingdom named Solamnia. Hope it's not some totalitarian dictatorship!
Locals said that tomorrow Solamnian Knights will come and personally welcome us. Hm...

Meredith eyes and skin are changing all the time in a colourful pattern, following the arrangement of moons in the sky. Makes sense. This night they changed again.
Knights came at dawn, and rudely demanded to see our third companion. Which companion? There were only two of us (Hearing knights approaching, Meredith opened some sort of pocket dimension and jumped in. Wonder if you can do this trick with Bag of Holding?)
Knights were not appeased, - and left empty-handed. Wearing heavy armor when you need stealth does this to you.
Twinkie tried to wigwag Meredith about his abilities, - in response he attempted to use some mind trick on her but failed.
I chimed in trying to squeeze a bit more from him, only to get the same treatment. I felt it would be wrong to tell that this sort of magick works only on berks, so I changed topic to getting out of there ASAP.

And so, our journey continued. Bend after bend, river getting wider.

After couple of weeks, we made a nice progress and approached place known as Vogler.
Rations were close to running out. Assuming that farmers are bringing their produce here, and huge competition drove prices down, we went it to get some supplies.
But no, apparently it was settled by highway robbers! We'd better starve than pay 7 gp for meager amount of food!

We've checked the map - big city named Kalaman was really close. Just one day of travel ahead!
Tried fishing, but nothing come out. Can raftsmen be an emergency meal? Was it in the contract? Anyway, gnawing on bark of the raft is more ethically conscious.

We reached Kalaman! On empty stomach, but safe and in one piece! Raft can't carry us any further - river was no more, widedning into the real salty sea.
I gave the pay to raftsmen, and even tipped 5 sp. for all the trouble. We parted ways.

First thing first, - we learned that next ship heading towards Nordmaar will be in 7 days. That gives us plenty of time to prepare.
As expected from the city, we found ample and cheap supply of tasty rations and nice lodgings. That left us with more than 5 days of a downtime.

We had only expenses and no fresh income, and five days to kill - made sense to fool around and find out where to get some nice clinking coin.
One offer was extremely rewarding, with bally amount of supplies being provided in advance. But recrutation was going on for a while, apparently all previous attempts failing. Planes differ, sure, but you know fishy stuff when you see it. Nope, hard pass.
Second one was more literally down-to-earth: cemetery, people dissappearing. Local priest gave us list of 3 missing persons. Swear I have it written down somewhere in pockets, no way I sneezed into it and threw it out!
They were so kind as to provide us with a nice mace and some armor, which we promptly stuffed into the bag.

Cemetery is located day and a half of travel away, and we headed to it. As I willed to reach it, we appeared there. That works on some planes, but for this one is uncharacteristic. Some magic at play? But I failed to grasp it, guess it's supposed to be that way sometimes.

We were met by gatekeeper, who confirmed disappearences. As we went past the gates (always gives me shivers) and into the cemetary I felt the influx of vital humours. I'm still a small kid on this plane, but my shadow grows larger. By focusing and exerting, I can catch a short glimpse of the near future now.

After searching around, and trying to pick up some traces, we found two dead bodies between two pillars, in front of mausoleum.
I heard "Awooo!"  - and immediately knew that it is not going to end up peacefully.
Two wolves! And a third thing... I KNOW THIS! SMALL WORG! IT'S SMART AND DANGEROUS AND WILL EAT YOU!
Meredith acted before I collected myself, and charmed one wolf. Twinkle manifested Grease. Worg is about to get hard time standing upright! Nasty smart spell.
One wolfsie bit another. With a little help from me, both were annigilated. Work followed the suit.
We were unscathed. Glorious victory!

There were not much loot to find besides trinkets to identify two victims. When we uncover whatever is happening there, though, wolfs can be skinned. Guess skin of an intelligent creature (worg) can worth some coin.

Next step? Mausoleum, of course.

There was some wreath made out of red roses laying on a fresh grave. Brutal - dead reproductive organs of trees, cut down and made into an ornament. I decorated my head and horns with them - whatever we're going to met will be intimidated, no doubt.

We're inside mausoleum. Some statue and steps down. Slow shuffling sound. Coffins.

I manifested Resist Cold Energy, just in case. You never know.
As we went down the stairs and deeper, nothing was threatening.
Until we poked into the nearest coffin to the left with a stick (naturally, how you can enter without disturbing undead?). And all the Hell broke loose!
Zombies, skeletons, and many, stood up! Benefit of having a blunt weapon was apparent immediately.
Arrows sunk into the undead corpses witout them flinching a bit. But the mace left hefty fragments detached.
That went for a while, us landing hits and zombies triyng to reach for our brains.
More skeletons were raising from behind the piles of rubble ahead!
And then one of zombies bit me! Disgusting! Painful!
Time to summon the powers of luck and heavy blunt object to my side. With a well-placed hit, zombie exploded into a shower of rotten innards.
Meredith fell another skeletom, another zombie was broken into pieces by combined efforts, too.
And then, pulling all my strength together, I annihilated the last one!

Finally, the dead were put to the twice-final rest.
We harvested approximately 100 gp in coins and trinkets scattered around the basement. It's not like the dead need it - the living ones will put them to use. Good for economy!

That is how I ended up here and now. Will this be the first and the last entry? Only the Lady Luck knows.

*Cough, cough* - Hircinius close the book, satisfied. Unholy smithereens settled down.

## Second

Hircinius scanned the basement. Any more twitching unpacified undead? Pupils of his yellow slitted eyes expanded, discerning detail a little farther, behind the pile of rubble. In a grayscale - you need some light to see the colour. No easy way (and a good chance to twist your ankle) if you go straight ahead, but there is an opening to the left.

Suddenly, a realisation struck him. What abouth the other pocket? Haven't been checked.

— Aha! Here is where my forensics. I did not sneezed into it, meh!

Hircinius extracted an old tattered scrap of parchment somewhere from under his chainshirt. The longer its folds and creases was observed, the more recognizable was resemblance of a screaming flattened face on it.

Besides semi-visible face, words in Diabolian were stamped on it:

```
	[YOU'RE INVITED]
	[THE NIGHT PARADE PROUDLY PRESENTS]
	[NEVER-MEANT-NEVER-ENDING PARTY]
	[MEET THE SECRET GUESTS: HARPERS]
```

— Ah, got that leaflet many-many harvests ago... Sweet old times.

Hircinus turned over the leaflet and checked notes that he scibed earlier on the back:

```
	Lost people: Desiree, [stains], Morgan
	We were met: by Gunar, Morgan's father
	Female elf: Kithara Timms
	Huge graveyard, series of tunnels under the hill

	Found 2 bodies:
	- Male dwarf
	- Female human
```

Hircinius looked around, poked ino one corpse, stuck a finger into its ear, sniffed it, and quickly added one more line (tail was still wet with the ink):
"- Human body, seems to be unrelated to sacrifices (?), just was not prepared for the burial yet"


Hircinius picked up a small lump of zombie's brain, mashed it, and thinly spread over the front of the leaflet.
And glued it as a next page into the impromptu diary/recipe book.

— Now it's all copacetic!

With that, Hircinius firmly slammed the tome shut.

## Third

— Oi, diary!
I lived long enough to write another entry! Now with an ample supply of the _best ink possible_!
Need to notice that I won't survive the second bloodletting like this.

*Hircinius was writing again. This time the tail tip was red; red with his own blood. Next to him was prostrated a corpse of a strange monster, with thick skin and jagged appendages that mercilessly squeezed whole puddle of blood from Hircinius innards.*

*Thick, viscous blood in the puddle was turning dark red first, then dark purple, then pitch black, with flamelike vapours emanating from it, and the vapours were dissipating into microscopic disappearing speckles, creating small vortexes in the process*

Observing _rubedo_ kind of transition, of my own blood aligning with the baseline reality of Krynn, provides incredible insight on the nature of magic. Would prefer to have someone else as a donor, though.
Could I put this knowledge to use?

*Hircinius mumbled a bit and made gestures with his hand. Nothing happened. Then he picked up a tiny stick, and ferociously moved it over a patch of fur near the right hoof. Stick started attracting particles of dust and dirt. Tiny sparkle erupted when Hircinius touched it with a tip of finger.*

Alas, mind over matter works, but not in the way I want. Knowing doesn't make something to happen.

Anyway, here is how it went so far:
Writing puts me into contemplative, detached mood.
When I come back to my senses after completing previous entry, Twinkie and Meridith were gone. They foolishly rushed ahead, deeper into the tunnels. I had no choice but to follow them. I'll make a pate to honour their memory one day.
They were alive, but small shadow was cautiously approaching.
"- Are you friend or food?" - I asked a standard greeting from the Demiplane of Nightmares (home, sweet home).
Shadow introduced himself as a Coal, _halfling_ (and a friend).

Now, I'm scared. In some places, devils, demons, robots, even humans (ew!) can peacefully walk side-by-side. But not the kender. They are hunted on sight. And the halfling is nearly the same thing!
Should I be in prison of my own racial stereotypes? I should approach Coal with an open heart (but watch my back).

After inquiring what he was doing here, halfling (I hope!) confessed to being a "bottom feeder" - he followed some people into the tunnels, keeping distance from them and picking up any valuable stuff that was left. Those people never come back, and he was hit in the head somewhere a bit deeper. After recovering, he went closer to the entrance point and met us.
Sounds believable.
We offered him to come with us. Made sense in the light of fact that Coal wasn't fast with running - any monsters will catch him first. I was sure that we're not going to regret this.

Coal asked about our mission. I started explaining our investigation and findings so far, but Twinkie pointed out that we already matched missing people with trinkets found on their bodies. No further investigation needed? I'm still not sure about it - sounds too simple - just wolves eating people? There should be some brain-fiddling involved!

Halfling happened to be rather insightful and curious! After going through politics, need to run away from providing kid support, and how the last mayor in one of towns I lived in ended up being lynched (and position abandoned), he asked about goatmen leading a slave rebellion of goats. I think he doesn't see the difference between goats and me. That reminds me of that encounter earlier between apemen. Was I so blind, too? I need to tread lightly when making generalisations.

And so brave adventurers went deeper into tunnels. No shambling zombies so far. We found a mold-covered statue, and round depression in the wall. Depression has something like a pie, cut into four slices, inside of it. On every slice, one of four animals was portrayed: ox, lion, eagle, deer. Oh, dear deer. A magical puzzle (I checked, it indeed emanated magic!). Coal said that he can't see how it can be lockpicked.
Welp, that's probably 16 combinations? With every wrong attempt sending a phantasm to kill you? Fearlessly, we decided to try. Brainstorm: position carnivores and herbivores so they won't eat each another? But how this thing rotates?
After few tries, we were still alive, and the lock activated, causing an entrance to appear in the wall! Time to rush in!

Or no? We heard wings flapping - four tiny flying constructs inside! I sniffed again - yep, there is some magic! Creatures suspiciously aligned itself, as if preparing to attack. After a bit of a standoff, we backtracked. Bravery dried out, better to be safe. Once some distance was put between us and constructs, one of them suddenly dashed to the animalistic puzzle, rearranged it back, and returned just in time before the hidden opening in the wall shut. All went quiet.

In a hindsight, we should have checked the statue. Probably there were some clues or context.

Marching further, we were met by choice of either going downstairs, or turning back. After bit of bickering (case is sort of solved, right?), we went down. This section of tunnels was noticeably older than the one upstairs. Brickwork was different, crumblier.

Sad that we don't have any mine-dwelling dwarfs with us, they sure would know more about the stonework.

My companions somehow manage to be cautious and recklessly head first going at the same time. Maybe there is some chaos in their heads?

Speaking of which. Poking with a 10-feet pole into seemingly solid wall, I met no resistance! It was just an illusion. Combined with a magical trap! There are two principal kinds of chaos: chaos in mind, and chaos in matter.  I'm the creature of the latter, while my companions are of the former, and the trap stung them! But nothing that can't be easily shrugged off.

DISSIPATING ILLUSION REVEALED BEHOLDER. I think we wet our pants. Nothing happened, though, no movement. Inconsistencies became apparent: beholder was rather two-dimensional, and was surrounding by images of 11 spell effects (And you should be able to recognize them - meeting beholder is like meeting 11 crazy angry wizards - you should be prepared for it, to run away as fast as possible).
No need to run. That is not a real beholder: it's just a door with quite lifelike depiction of one. Another puzzle?

Door happened to be unlocked (or was that Coal?), and led into heavily magic-infused hall. There were pedestals and tablets, all soaked with magic. Puzzle indeed.
Fortunately, puzzle seemed to be rather easy (unless its builder was cheeky bastard, always a possibility). Tablets corresponded to the spell effect images on the door, and we just arranged them the same way on the pedestals. Expecting a surprise lightning bolt or barrel of acid or killer bees at any moment. Instead, with quiet click, two hidden crawlspaces opened, one surrounded by greenish glow.
Which kind of: good healy or bad necromancey? We went in to check.
And found a nice 20x20 feet-sized furnished room with foodstuffs, fireplace, and even more of magical saturation.

So heavily magic-rich places are rarity in Krynn: in one month of travel I did not registered anything obviously magical at all. What we have signed up for with this investigation, where it's going to lead us?

After taking a rest in the magical room (NOTHING HAS HAPPENED, which is extremely surprising - it could've been a wicked trap), we went into the second crawlspace.

It led into the narrow downward staircase where were met by two skeletal dogs. Finally, a battle! After trading hits and misses, dogs were broken into pieces. Nothing spectacular, just gradually milling undead abomination until it is no longer operational.

In the corridor after stairs, we found lethargic zombie ogre. It shambled erratically, and then fell. Time to make sure that it's going to stay down! With determination, four adventurers attacked it, hitting, squashing and hacking at it.
Twinkie cast Grease, which ensured that zombie stays down. Good thinking!
I just pondered zombie with a mace, one hit after another.
Meridith did his thing, whatever it was.
Coal tried to hit it with a knife, but missed. Tried to recover, but instead hit himself into the leg. Tried to do it one more time, and stabbed himself into the heart. "Nothing to worry about, nothing to see!" - just a cheerful reaction from him. Due to sheer amount of halfling luck, somehow he was left with unsignificant scratches.
After the Grease spell has dissipated, zombie ogre tried to stood up, and this provided us with an opportunity to fully break it down. It was no longer animated.

Quick search revealed 20 gp in valuables, and we went further ahead.

Surprise! A sight to behold. We found a sturdy-looking bridge spanning over a depth with some water below. I tried to spot some movement under it, and I swear I saw something in the corner of my eye, but nothing definite. Seems to be quiet. Probably some ancient underwater monstrosity  that wants to charm, corrupt, and enslave waits for us there, what else it could be? Bridge is going to break down when we're right in the middle!

We went one-by-one over it, me going the last. Surprisingly, all went well.

And then, just after I put my hoof on a solid ground, bridge crashed down with unbelievably loud, dimensions-piercing sound.
There is no way back now.

## Fourth

— Oi, I am back! Things disrupted the flow of my tale, but they've been taken care of. Method was brutal and efficient. So, after the broken bridge... I need more stuff for writing on first!

*Hircinius perched on the edge of a beatufil sparkling fountain. Stone dragon figurine spewed forth a thick jet of fresh, reinvigorating water. This time, Hircinius was writing using a common ink, poking the tail tip into the water, then into the ink bottle, and taking care as to not contaminate the pristine water of the fountain.*

*Goatman pulled out a scroll from the bag. It was thick, __serious__. A short inscription in Draconic omniously warned:*

```
We who rest still long to serve.
If you seek the same, take our goods and be blessed.
If greed moved this stone and not a true heart, may our curse find you [moth-eaten]ere we awake
```

— Nice. That will do!

*Ignoring the warning, Hircinius tore the scroll into few sheets and put them into the diary, expanding it with a much-needed blank space, making it ready to cover his recent adventurers. With renewed focus, he resumed writing, detailing every step of his journey in the world of Krynn.*

Now, as the blank pages issue is taken care of - about the after-bridge time.

We found ourseleves in a wide corridor with two half-open doors to the left and to the right.
After cautiously peeking into the right one, we decided go into the left one. But not so fast! - Meridith stopped us. There is a beast inside! Some type of an overgrown ferret?

Meridith knew more about the beast than he told us. Or it was telepathy? Beast desired tasties and shinies. With the first one I readily supplied 2 travel rations, and for the second desire, - I reminded Twinkie that as a gnome she can use her power of magical prestigitation - one that can turn a common pebble into something that could pass for a gemstone. At least for an hour.

Really funny word - try pronouncing it fast: "prestidigitation", "prestidigitation", "prestidigitation"...
And that is why you need to wait for a few hours when striking a deal with a gnome, or make sure it won't run away. Precious stones and fabrics might be worthless pebbles and rags, just enchanted with glamours and magics!

Now, the ferret-thingie was satisfied by food and colored pebbles, and moved somewhere back and then rapidly up? At least it did not attacked.
Following the trail, we found ourselves at the bottom of a collapsed sinkhole! Scattered beams of daylight shone down upon us from above.
Some pitons were already put into the wall.

We ascended. Having a lot of spare rope helps.
Sinkhole widened into the platform with trees and greens and a blue sky above. Our guard was momentarily down. For a moment I thought we're going to get dismembered by angry trees. Happens sometimes.
I heard a guttural sound, something like a "blargk!" and barely managed to jump away from the ball of acid thrown at my legs!
IT WAS NOT ENTS, IT WAS SOME THICK-SKINNED TENTACLED CANINE!
Twinkie whispered word of encouragement. It helps, I hope, for we need anything that could give an advantage. Beast happened to be unexpectedly tough, shrugging away combined assault from four creatures as if we were rubbing its tummy, not trying to pound it into mincemeat.
Lady Luck was on our side this time. Beast missed few times, while we continued to scratch it, trying to break through its thick hide.
Well, nothing runs forever, especially luck. It got me and Meridith, and got us bad! One more hit like this and we're down!
But the beast was not in a good shape either, collecting hits and bruises.
It went belly-up, and not for the rubs, before it could down any of us. VICTORY!

No more beasts or angry trees were coming, giving an opportunity to lick our wounds and recuperate.
As I wrote earlier, blood is a good ink (especially when it is not mine). So I chronicled what has happened so far.

Then, a sudden realisation dawned on me. I have the knowledge of magic, true, but what I'm missing is perseverance. It's subtle at times, like a distinction between adventure and endeavor: one relies on a stroke of luck, while the second needs long concentrated effort.
Forcing order over chaos is never an easy task, one that many will miserably fail at. Like me before.
But this time, I kept pushing. Few unseen electrons at fist, followed by microscopic sparkle between two motes of dust.
Spontaneous currents began to align.
I repeated the incantation, maybe for the thousandth time, calling on the rage of my youth. To my surprise, matter of Krynn responded with a fierce reaction, one I had never thought to see again.
It was more than just sparkles of a Shocking Grasp. The spell flowed into the weapon I had at hand - spiked chain - and animated it! Like a rabid snake, it thrashed and lunged around, searching for live beings to fry and metallic massess to connect to. 
Long-forgotten Art, one that combined might and magic, had been reborn in Krynn, at my hands.

I noticed Meridith staring at me. Surely he is impressed by this stunning display of Art! Surprise: instead of an applause, he asked a question:

— Where are your belongings? Have you checked them?

— Wha, why? - stuttered I. — Right here!

But they were not. My hand grasped at nothing but a thin air. Chunk of rope, clearly cut, was all that remained.

"— Coal", - softly said Meridith - "Give it back."

— "I have no idea what you're talking about!" - Coal's reply was unconvincing. 

Meridith's eyes glowed up with an inner light. Exacerbating the contrast, his face turned pitch black, becoming a dark, light-absorbing void.

In a hindsight, how silly was of me to think that only I had gotten better at the Art! Looking into the eyes of Death, you either become stronger, or succumb to it.

— "Don't ever steal from your party members and give back the weapons you took previously." - Meridith said and Coal obeyed.

Bag of holding exchanged hands, coming back to its familiar place.
With a "troomp!" sound, another bag, full of weapons that Coal has pocketed, fell down. I was more impressed than angry - it takes balls to steal from awake armed people during the fight. That's not something your average run-of-the-mill berk woud ever dare to do!

It wasn't the end of surprises for the day. As Meridith deeply stared at me, ripples formed on the void of his face, and in a blink there was a SECOND ME!

He took on my appearance! I was double-robbed today!

— Hey, looking good! - I commented. — But I know what will make it even better... I've got an idea.

How Meridith can make it better? By taking a female diabolus visage, of course! I had just a thing for this: medallion with a lovely diva image, gifted to me by her personally many harvests ago. Medallion was instrumental for lightening up the mood during lone evenings the whole time we travelled by raft.

I reached down into the pocket, but my hand closed around nothing but fluff. Another pocket? Nothing. COAL? COAL!

— Coal, where are you?

No answer. No halfling in sight. Only quiet creaking coming from ropes and pitons. He run back into the underground!

No words were needed. We descended as fast as we could, balancing speed and chance to become an omelette.

Coal was right there, in front of a collapsed bridge, deep in contemplation. Was he thinking how to cross it?

There was no time to think what to do with Coal. No end for surprises today.
Out of nowhere, an orc barbarian charged and downed Coal in one hit! He fell down like a bag with potatoes. Probably, chunks of his brain still were thinking what to do next.

An orc roared triumphantly:
"— I sniffed him! He's evil!"

Now, I'm all for punishing thieves, but outright killing the person (even if it might be a kender) is inexcusable. I readied my weapon but couldn't resist making a comment:

— Wow Twinkie, are you aware about existence of the Magical Axiom of triplets and quintuplets? It stipulates that rare magical effects happens in sequences of three or five. I wonder, are we witnessing triplet or quantuplet?

That brought an attention of an orc to us. Doubt he understood anything of what I said.

"— Are you evil? I can sniff it!" - come from him.

— Hey, you killed him! You can't just kill people even if they're evil! You need a trial!

"— Wha? Are you with him? Are you friend?" - *Sniff, sniff*

At that moment, I stared casting uttering arcance invokations, opening my mind to see into the nearest future. Presented with in-one-hit killing machine, you want to be sure to act right and strike hard. To my surprise, in the vision orc was still standing in the same place, just a little bit angrier. 

"— What is that?" - howled orc.

— Has he stolen from you? - I retorted.

Aha! That was what made him angrier.

— "Yes! That is why I tracked and killed him!" - confirmed the orc.

— We're friends, sure, but just killing people for thievery is wrong. Let's check on him, and give hime at least a proper burial! - I don't want to anger him any further. Especially seeing as out of companions, only I was somewhat concerned with the deed.

"— Why it is?"

— We should pay him some last respect. Plus, I need to check if one precious medallion is still with him. -  I looked at Meridith who still was a duplicate of me - It has a perfect example to use for your newfound transformation.

That somewhat agitated Meridith. He looked at the orc and commanded:

"— No, no. I say you just throw the corpse down."

Orc immediately followed the order and tossed the corpse down. Halfling fell into the darkness, and the loud "splash" was his eulogy. Was it my imagination, or I heard "nom-nom-nom" sounds coming from below afterwards?

My precious medallion was gone.

With no corpse, there was no more room for bickering. Orc introduced himself as "Krull", and we returned the favor.

Another thought formed in my head: if Coal stole from Krull, then the gold was still with the corpse when it was thrown down. I decided it was best to keep this to myself, - Krull might jump down or rage. Maybe even both at the same time.

— Anyway, nice to meet you, Krull! The bridge is collapsed, we came from the left opening. Let's go to the right this time? Take this masterwork greataxe as a token of our friendship!
